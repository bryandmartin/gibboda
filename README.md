Gender Isn't Binary But Other Data Are!

In statistics, we often require example data with binary variables.
For far too long, the canonical example of a binary variable has been gender.
This doesn't make much sense, since gender isn't binary!

The aim of this package is to serve as a repository for fun and easy-to-use data that includes actual binary data!

## Installation

## Pull Requests/Updates
